    "abstract": "Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are a genetically diverse species, consisting of four highly distinct subspecies. As humans closest living relative, they have been a key  model organism in the study of human evolution, and comparisons of human and  chimpanzee transcriptomes have been widely used to characterize differences in gene  expression levels that could underlie the phenotypic differences between the two  species. However, the subspecies from which these transcriptomic data sets have been  derived is not recorded in metadata available in the public NCBI Sequence Read  Archive (SRA). Furthermore, labeling of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) samples is for the  most part inconsistent across studies, and the true number of individuals from whom  transcriptomic data are available is difficult to ascertain. Thus, we have evaluated  genetic diversity at the subspecies and individual level in 486 public RNA-seq  samples available in the SRA, spanning the vast majority of public chimpanzee  transcriptomic data. Using multiple population genetics approaches, we find that  nearly all samples (96.6%) have some degree of Western chimpanzee ancestry. At the  individual donor level, we identify multiple samples that have been repeatedly  analyzed across different studies and identify a total of 135 genetically distinct  individuals within our data, a number that falls to 89 when we exclude likely first-  and second-degree relatives. Altogether, our results show that current  transcriptomic data from chimpanzees are capturing low levels of genetic diversity  relative to what exists in wild chimpanzee populations. These findings provide  important context to current comparative transcriptomics research involving  chimpanzees.",

    "abstract": "Most primates experience seasonal fluctuations in the availability of food resources and face the challenge of balancing energy expenditure with energy gain during  periods of resource scarcity. This is likely to be particularly challenging in  rugged, montane environments, where available energy is relatively low and travel  costs are high. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) show extensive behavioral diversity  across study sites. Yet, as most research has focused on low- and mid-elevation  sites, little is known on how chimpanzees respond to periods of low fruit  availability in harsh montane environments. We use focal follow and phenology data  to investigate how fruit availability influences daily path length and monthly home  range in chimpanzees living in Nyungwe National Park, a montane forest in Rwanda.  Nyungwe chimpanzees decreased their daily travel distances during periods of fruit  scarcity. However, this decrease in travel effort did not correspond with a decrease  in foraging area. Instead, monthly homes ranges shifted location across the study  period. Nyungwe chimpanzees occupy a relatively wide altitudinal range and the  shifts in monthly home range location may reflect differences in the altitudinal  distribution of food resources. Chimpanzee monthly diet was often dominated by one  or two species and each of these species were confined to different elevation zones.  One important species, Podocarpus latifolius, grew only at high elevations  (2,600-2,950m) and chimpanzees ranged at the altitudinal peak of their range for 2  consecutive months while feeding on this species. Thus, while high elevations are  often thought to be harsh environments for primates, they can be an important part  of a species home range when they provide a refugium for densely distributed,  important food species.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Economists believe that barter is the ultimate cause of social wealth--and even much of our human culture--yet little is known about the evolution  and development of such behavior. It is useful to examine the circumstances under  which other species will or will not barter to more fully understand the phenomenon.  Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are an interesting test case as they are an  intelligent species, closely related to humans, and known to participate in  reciprocal interactions and token economies with humans, yet they have not  spontaneously developed costly barter. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: Although  chimpanzees do engage in noncostly barter, in which otherwise value-less tokens are  exchanged for food, this lack of risk is not typical of human barter. Thus, we  systematically examined barter in chimpanzees to ascertain under what circumstances  chimpanzees will engage in costly barter of commodities, that is, trading food items  for other food items with a human experimenter. We found that chimpanzees do barter,  relinquishing lower value items to obtain higher value items (and not the reverse).  However, they do not trade in all beneficial situations, maintaining possession of  less preferred items when the relative gains they stand to make are small.  CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Two potential explanations for this puzzling behavior are  that chimpanzees lack ownership norms, and thus have limited opportunity to benefit  from the gains of trade, and that chimpanzees risk of defection is sufficiently  high that large gains must be imminent to justify the risk. Understanding the  conditions that support barter in chimpanzees may increase understanding of  situations in which humans, too, do not maximize their gains.",

    "abstract": "There are thousands of fossils of hominins, but no fossil chimpanzee has yet been reported. The chimpanzee (Pan) is the closest living relative to humans. Chimpanzee  populations today are confined to wooded West and central Africa, whereas most  hominin fossil sites occur in the semi-arid East African Rift Valley. This situation  has fuelled speculation regarding causes for the divergence of the human and  chimpanzee lineages five to eight million years ago. Some investigators have invoked  a shift from wooded to savannah vegetation in East Africa, driven by climate change,  to explain the apparent separation between chimpanzee and human ancestral  populations and the origin of the unique hominin locomotor adaptation, bipedalism.  The Rift Valley itself functions as an obstacle to chimpanzee occupation in some  scenarios. Here we report the first fossil chimpanzee. These fossils, from the  Kapthurin Formation, Kenya, show that representatives of Pan were present in the  East African Rift Valley during the Middle Pleistocene, where they were contemporary  with an extinct species of Homo. Habitats suitable for both hominins and chimpanzees  were clearly present there during this period, and the Rift Valley did not present  an impenetrable barrier to chimpanzee occupation.",

Bishop Wilberforce would no doubt have shaken his fist at it, just as he disputed Huxleys championing of  darwinian continuity. But the title of this essay is no more outrageous than one  entitled The chimpanzees bird brain, for there has been extensive evolutionary  conservation of many neural and psychological functions across species. We share  with chimpanzees some--but not all--mental functions, some of which are shared with  other species as well. As the publication of the chimpanzee genome reveals, we also  share a good deal of our DNA. Unfortunately, we are virtually in the dark when it  comes to understanding how genes build minds.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The emergence of human-unique cognitive abilities has been linked to our species extended juvenile period. Comparisons of cognitive development across  species can provide new insights into the evolutionary mechanisms shaping cognition.  This study examined the development of different components of spatial memory,  cognitive mechanisms that support complex foraging, by comparing two species with  similar life history that vary in wild ecology: bonobos (Pan paniscus) and  chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Spatial memory development was  assessed using a cross-sectional experimental design comparing apes ranging from  infancy to adulthood. Study 1 tested 73 sanctuary-living apes on a task examining  recall of a single location after a 1-week delay, compared to an earlier session.  Study 2 tested their ability to recall multiple locations within a complex  environment. Study 3 examined a subset of individuals from Study 2 on a motivational  control task. RESULTS: In Study 1, younger bonobos and chimpanzees of all ages  exhibited improved performance in the test session compared to their initial  learning experience. Older bonobos, in contrast, did not exhibit a memory boost in  performance after the delay. In Study 2, older chimpanzees exhibited an improved  ability to recall multiple locations, whereas bonobos did not exhibit any  age-related differences. In Study 3, both species were similarly motivated to search  for food in the absence of memory demands. DISCUSSION: These results indicate that  closely related species with similar life history characteristics can exhibit  divergent patterns of cognitive development, and suggests a role of socioecological  niche in shaping patterns of cognition in Pan.",

    "abstract": "The marginal value theorem is an optimal foraging model that predicts how efficient foragers should respond to both their ecological and social environments when  foraging in food patches, and it has strongly influenced hypotheses for primate  behavior. Nevertheless, experimental tests of the marginal value theorem have been  rare in primates and observational studies have provided conflicting support. As a  step towards filling this gap, we test whether the foraging decisions of captive  chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) adhere to the assumptions and qualitative predictions  of the marginal value theorem. We presented 12 adult chimpanzees with a two-patch  foraging environment consisting of both low-quality (i.e., low-food density) and  high-quality (i.e., high-food density) patches and examined the effect of patch  quality on their search behavior, foraging duration, marginal capture rate, and its  proxy measures: giving-up density and giving-up time. Chimpanzees foraged longer in  high-quality patches, as predicted. In contrast to predictions, they did not depress  high-quality patches as thoroughly as low-quality patches. Furthermore, since  chimpanzees searched in a manner that fell between systematic and random, their  intake rates did not decline at a steady rate over time, especially in high-quality  patches, violating an assumption of the marginal value theorem. Our study provides  evidence that chimpanzees are sensitive to their rate of energy intake and that  their foraging durations correlate with patch quality, supporting many assumptions  underlying primate foraging and social behavior. However, our results question  whether the marginal value theorem is a constructive model of chimpanzee foraging  behavior, and we suggest a Bayesian foraging framework (i.e., combining past  foraging experiences with current patch sampling information) as a potential  alternative. More work is needed to build an understanding of the proximate  mechanisms underlying primate foraging decisions, especially in more complex  socioecological environments.",

    "abstract": "Following the first long-term field studies of chimpanzees in the 1960s, researchers began to suspect that chimpanzees from different African populations varied in their  behavior, and that some of these variations were transmitted through social  learning, thus suggesting culture. Additional reports of chimpanzee culture have  since accumulated, which involve an increasing amount of behavioral variation that  has no obvious ecological or genetic explanation. To date, close to 50 cultural  variants have been reported, including subsistence behavior, tool-use, communication  signals, and grooming patterns. Nevertheless, field studies lack the experimental  controls and manipulations necessary to conclusively demonstrate that the observed  variation results from differential invention and social transmission of behavior.  This would require that behavioral variants have been learned from others, a  question best addressed in a controlled experimental setting. The following chapter  details a series of experimental studies at Yerkes National Primate Research Center  of Emory University. In each case, the behavior of two captive groups (each N=12  individuals) was compared before and after the introduction of a novel foraging  behavior by a trained conspecific 'inventor.' The studies were designed to  investigate (i) the conditions under which chimpanzees learn from one another, (ii)  how behaviors are transmitted, (iii) how cultures are maintained over generations.  The results emphasize the importance of integrating both fieldwork and experimental  approaches. Previous studies have reported deficits in chimpanzees cultural  capacities, but did so after testing them with human models, which are largely  irrelevant to the problem at hand. A representative understanding of culture can  only be gained when efforts are made to create a naturalistic learning environment  in which chimpanzees have opportunities to learn spontaneously from conspecifics in  a familiar social setting.",

    "abstract": "There is broad consensus among paleoanthropologists that meat-eating played a key role in the evolution of Homo, but the details of where, when, and why are hotly  debated. It has been argued that increased faunivory was causally connected with  hominin adaptation to open, savanna habitats. If savanna-dwelling chimpanzees eat  meat more frequently than do forest chimpanzees, it would support the notion that  open, dry, seasonal habitats promote hunting or scavenging by hominoids. Here we  present observational and fecal analysis data on vertebrate consumption from several  localities within the dry, open Ugalla region of Tanzania. Combining these with  published fecal analyses, we summarize chimpanzee vertebrate consumption rates,  showing quantitatively that savanna chimpanzee populations do not differ  significantly from forest populations. Compared with forest populations, savanna  chimpanzees consume smaller vertebrates that are less likely to be shared, and they  do so more seasonally. Analyses of chimpanzee hunting that focus exclusively on  capture of forest monkeys are thus difficult to apply to chimpanzee faunivory in  open-country habitats and may be misleading when used to model early hominin  behavior. These findings bear on discussions of why chimpanzees hunt and suggest  that increases in hominin faunivory were related to differences between hominins and  chimpanzees and/or differences between modern and Pliocene savanna woodland  environments.",

I systematically compare the two taxa, going beyond simple  presence/absence scoring of tool-using and -making types, on four more precise  aspects of material culture: (i) types of associative technology (tools used in  combination); (ii) modes of tool making; (iii) modes of tool use; and (iv) functions  of tool use. I emphasize tool use in nature, when performance is habitual or  customary, rather than in anecdotal or idiosyncratic. On all four measures, the ape  shows more variety than does the corvid, especially in modes and functions that go  beyond extractive foraging. However, more sustained field research is required on  the crows before this contrast is conclusive.",

    "abstract": "To improve our understanding of the evolutionary origins of culture and technology in humans, it is vital that we document the full extent of behavioural diversity in  our great ape relatives. About half of the worlds remaining chimpanzees (Pan spp.)  live in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), yet until now we have known almost  nothing about their behaviour. Here we describe the insect-related tool technology  of Bili-Uéré chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) inhabiting an area of at  least a 50,000-km2 area in northern DRC, as well as their percussive technology  associated with food processing. Over a 12-year period, we documented chimpanzee  tools and artefacts at 20 survey areas and gathered data on dung, feeding remains  and sleeping nests. We describe a new chimpanzee tool kit: long probes used to  harvest epigaeic driver ants (Dorylus spp.), short probes used to extract ponerine  ants and the arboreal nests of stingless bees, wands to dip for D. kohli and stout  digging sticks used to access underground meliponine bee nests. Epigaeic Dorylus  tools were significantly longer than the other tool types, and D. kohli tools were  significantly thinner. Tools classified as terrestrial honey-digging sticks were a  significant predictor for brushed and blunted tool ends, consistent with their  presumed use. We describe two potential new tool types, an 'ant scoop' and a 'fruit  hammer.' We document an extensive percussive technology used to process termite  mounds of Cubitermes sp. and Thoracotermes macrothorax and hard-shelled fruits such  as Strychnos, along with evidence of the pounding open of African giant snails and  tortoises. We encountered some geographic variation in behaviour: we found  honey-digging tools, long driver ant probes and fruit-pounding sites only to the  north of the Uele River; there were more epigaeic Dorylus tools to the north and  more ponerine ant tools to the south. We found no evidence of termite-fishing,  despite the availability of Macrotermes muelleri mounds throughout the region. This  lack of evidence is consistent with the results of dung washes, which revealed a  substantial proportion of driver ants, but no evidence of Macrotermes or other  termites. Our results allow us to describe a new chimpanzee behavioural complex,  characterised by a general similarity of multiple behaviours across a large,  ecologically diverse region but with subtle differences in prey choice and  techniques. We propose that this widespread and related suite of behaviours be  referred to as the Bili-Uéré Chimpanzee Behavioural Realm. Possible explanations for  this pattern are a recent chimpanzee expansion across the region and the  interconnectedness of this population across at least the entirety of northern DRC.",

    "abstract": "The study of representational play in nonhuman primates, including chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), provides interspecific perspectives on human cognitive development and  evolution. A notable form of representational play in chimpanzees is play parenting,  wherein parental behavior is directed at inanimate objects. Though observed in  captivity, unambiguous examples of play parenting by wild chimpanzees are rare.  Here, we report two cases from Ngogo in Kibale National Park, Uganda, in which a  wild adult female chimpanzee (P. t. schweinfurthii) directed parental behaviors at  corpses. Both cases involved the same adult female chimpanzee, aged 20-21years. The  first case was observed on 5 March 2016, and the play object was the corpse of a  bushbaby (Galago thomasi); in the second case, observed on 6 May 2017, the play  object was a recently deceased chimpanzee infant postmortally stolen from the  mother. The chimpanzee possessed the first and second play objects for approximately  5.5h and 1.8h, respectively. In both cases, she performed a variety of maternal  behaviors, including co-nesting, grooming, and dorsally carrying the play objects.  In contrast to previous observations of play parenting in captivity, the play parent  was a presumably sterile adult female, well beyond the average age of first birth.  These observations contribute to the expanding literature on chimpanzee interactions  with the corpses of both conspecifics and heterospecifics.",

    "abstract": "Errors of source monitoring are widespread human memory challenges, and our memories are subject to distortion upon the presentation of subsequent misinformation. Less  is known about if and when misinformation effects occur in nonhuman species memory.  Here we tested a symbol-trained chimpanzees recall memoryof a hidden food items  identity after a 10-min delay. During this delay, the subject was sometimes  (depending onthecondition) shown consistent or inconsistent video information  about the identity of the food, before being asked to name the item to a second  experimenter blind to the reward and condition. Across all conditions, our subject,  Sherman, correctly named the food item at above chance levels. In the Inconsistent  condition, in which Sherman was shown a video with misleading information, his  performance was the worst of all conditions (although accuracy was still high).  Interestingly, however, during three of the four trials in this condition in which  Sherman made a mistake, he incorrectly named the food item shown during the  misleading video information. These results provide evidence that chimpanzees, like  humans, may be vulnerable to misinformation effects, even when that misleading  information is presented in a different modality (video) than the original live  event memory, demonstrating further commonality between human and ape memory  systems.",

    "abstract": "In wild animal conservation, knowing the age of an individual animal is extremely beneficial. However, estimating the age is difficult for many species. Recently,  epigenetics-based methods of estimating age have been reported. These studies were  predominantly on humans with few reports on other animals, especially wild animals.  In the present study, a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) age prediction model was  developed based on the ELOVL2, CCDC102B, and ZNF423 genes that may also have  application in human age prediction. Pyrosequencing was used to measure methylation  in 20 chimpanzee blood samples and correlation between age and methylation status  was calculated. Age and methylation of sites in ELOVL2 and CCDC102B were  significantly correlated and an age prediction model was created using these genes.  In the regression equation using only ELOVL2, the highest correlation coefficient  was 0.741, with a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 5.41, compared with the  combination of ELOVL2 and CCDC102B, where the highest correlation coefficient was  0.742 and the MAD was 5.41. Although larger MADs were observed in chimpanzees than  in humans based on these genes, the results indicate the feasibility of estimating  chimpanzee age using DNA methylation, and can have implications in understanding the  ecology of chimpanzees and chimpanzee conservation.",

    "abstract": "Arboreal primates such as chimpanzees exhibit pronounced curvature in their hand and foot phalanges, which is assumed to develop throughout life in response to  mechanical loads produced by grasping and hanging from branches. Intriguingly,  ancient fossil hominins also exhibit substantial phalangeal curvature, which, too,  has been interpreted as a direct result of habitual arboreality during life. Here,  we describe the phalangeal curvature of a chimpanzee who was raised during the 1930s  in New York City to live much like a human, including by having very few  opportunities to engage in arboreal activities. We show that the degree of hand and  foot phalangeal curvature in this individual is indistinguishable from that of wild  chimpanzees and distinct from humans. Thus, rather than being a direct effect of  mechanical loads produced by lifetime arboreal activities, phalangeal curvature  appears to be shaped largely by genetic factors. An important implication of this  finding is that phalangeal curvature among fossil hominins is evidently best  interpreted as a primitive trait inherited from an arboreal ancestral species rather  than proof of engagement in arboreal activities during life.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Many aspects of chimpanzee ankle and midfoot joint morphology are believed to reflect adaptations for arboreal locomotion. However, terrestrial travel  also constitutes a significant component of chimpanzee locomotion, complicating  functional interpretations of chimpanzee and fossil hominin foot morphology. Here we  tested hypotheses of foot motion and, in keeping with general assumptions, we  predicted that chimpanzees would use greater ankle and midfoot joint ranges of  motion during travel on arboreal supports than on the ground. METHODS: We used a  high-speed motion capture system to measure three-dimensional kinematics of the  ankle and midfoot joints in two male chimpanzees during three locomotor modes:  terrestrial quadrupedalism on a flat runway, arboreal quadrupedalism on a  horizontally oriented tree trunk, and climbing on a vertically oriented tree trunk.  RESULTS: Chimpanzees used relatively high ankle joint dorsiflexion angles during all  three locomotor modes, although dorsiflexion was greatest in arboreal modes. They  used higher subtalar joint coronal plane ranges of motion during terrestrial and  arboreal quadrupedalism than during climbing, due in part to their use of high  eversion angles in the former. Finally, they used high midfoot inversion angles  during arboreal locomotor modes, but used similar midfoot sagittal plane kinematics  across all locomotor modes. DISCUSSION: The results indicate that chimpanzees use  large ranges of motion at their various ankle and midfoot joints during both  terrestrial and arboreal locomotion. Therefore, we argue that chimpanzee foot  anatomy enables a versatile locomotor repertoire, and urge caution when using foot  joint morphology to reconstruct arboreal behavior in fossil hominins.",

    "abstract": "Polymorphisms of the arginine vasopressin receptor 1a (AVPR1a) gene have been linked to various measures related to human social behavior, including sibling conflict and  agreeableness. In chimpanzees, AVPR1a polymorphisms have been associated with traits  important for social interactions, including sociability, joint attention,  dominance, conscientiousness, and hierarchical personality dimensions named low  alpha/stability, disinhibition, and negative emotionality/low dominance. We examined  associations between AVPR1a and six personality domains and hierarchical personality  dimensions in 129 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) living in Japan or in a sanctuary in  Guinea. We fit three linear and three animal models. The first model included  genotype, the second included sex and genotype, and the third included genotype,  sex, and sex×genotype. All personality phenotypes were heritable. Chimpanzees  possessing the long form of the allele were higher in conscientiousness, but only in  models that did not include the other predictors; however, additional analyses  suggested that this may have been a consequence of study design. In animal models  that included sex and sex×genotype, chimpanzees homozygous for the short form of  the allele were higher in extraversion. Taken with the findings of previous studies  of chimpanzees and humans, the findings related to conscientiousness suggest that  AVPR1a may be related to lower levels of impulsive aggression. The direction of the  association between AVPR1a genotype and extraversion ran counter to what one would  expect if AVPR1a was related to social behaviors. These results help us further  understand the genetic basis of personality in chimpanzees.",

    "abstract": "We studied the nesting behavior of the critically endangered West African chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus). We assumed that the nesting data stemmed from a single,  unhabituated community at the Bagnomba hill site in the savanna-woodlands of  southeastern Senegal. The aim of this study was to examine chimpanzees nesting  habits in terms of the tree species utilized and sleeping nest heights. We recorded  a total of 550 chimpanzee nests at Bagnomba between January 2015 and December 2015.  The chimpanzees here made nests in particular tree species more often than others.  The majority of nests (63%) were in two tree species: Diospyros mespiliformis and  Pterocarpus erinaceus. The average height of nesting trees was 10.54m (SD 3.91,  range, 0.0-29.0m) and average nest height was 7.90m (SD 3.62, range, 0.0-25.0m).  The result of a linear regression analysis (r=0.7874; n=550; p<0.05) is  consistent with a preference for nesting at a particular height. Bagnomba  chimpanzees rarely made ground nests (0.36% of nests), but the presence of any  ground nesting was unexpected, given that at least one leopard (Panthera pardus)  also occupied the hill. This knowledge will enable stakeholders involved in the  protection of chimpanzees specifically and of biodiversity in general to better  understand chimpanzee ecology and inform a conservation action plan in Senegal where  the survival of this species is threatened.",
