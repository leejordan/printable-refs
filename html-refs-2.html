    <b>Abstract:</b>
    There is broad consensus among paleoanthropologists that meat-eating played a key role in the evolution of Homo, but the details of where, when, and why are hotly debated. It has been argued that increased faunivory was causally connected with hominin adaptation to open, savanna habitats. If savanna-dwelling chimpanzees eat meat more frequently than do forest chimpanzees, it would support the notion that open, dry, seasonal habitats promote hunting or scavenging by hominoids. Here we present observational and fecal analysis data on vertebrate consumption from several localities within the dry, open Ugalla region of Tanzania. Combining these with published fecal analyses, we summarize chimpanzee vertebrate consumption rates, showing quantitatively that savanna chimpanzee populations do not differ significantly from forest populations. Compared with forest populations, savanna chimpanzees consume smaller vertebrates that are less likely to be shared, and they do so more seasonally. Analyses of chimpanzee hunting that focus exclusively on capture of forest monkeys are thus difficult to apply to chimpanzee faunivory in open-country habitats and may be misleading when used to model early hominin behavior. These findings bear on discussions of why chimpanzees hunt and suggest that increases in hominin faunivory were related to differences between hominins and chimpanzees and/or differences between modern and Pliocene savanna woodland environments.

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    There are thousands of fossils of hominins, but no fossil chimpanzee has yet been reported. The chimpanzee ( Pan) is the closest living relative to humans(1). Chimpanzee populations today are confined to wooded West and central Africa, whereas most hominin fossil sites occur in the semi-arid East African Rift Valley. This situation has fuelled speculation regarding causes for the divergence of the human and chimpanzee lineages five to eight million years ago. Some investigators have invoked a shift from wooded to savannah vegetation in East Africa, driven by climate change, to explain the apparent separation between chimpanzee and human ancestral populations and the origin of the unique hominin locomotor adaptation, bipedalism(2-5). The Rift Valley itself functions as an obstacle to chimpanzee occupation in some scenarios(6). Here we report the first fossil chimpanzee. These fossils, from the Kapthurin Formation, Kenya, show that representatives of Pan were present in the East African Rift Valley during the Middle Pleistocene, where they were contemporary with an extinct species of Homo. Habitats suitable for both hominins and chimpanzees were clearly present there during this period, and the Rift Valley did not present an impenetrable barrier to chimpanzee occupation.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), eukaryotic transposable elements, exist as proviruses in vertebrates including primates and contribute to genomic changes during the evolution of their host genomes. Many studies about ERVs have focused on the elements residing in the human genome but only a few studies have focused on the elements which exist in non-human primate genomes. In this study, we identified 256 chimpanzee-specific endogenous retrovirus copies (PtERVs: Pan troglodyte endogenous retroviruses) from the chimpanzee reference genome sequence through comparative genomics. Among the chimpanzee-specific ERV copies, 121 were full-length chimpanzee-specific ERV elements while 110 were chimpanzee-specific solitary LTR copies. In addition, we found eight potential retrotransposition-competent full-length chimpanzee-specific ERV copies containing an intact env gene, and two of them were polymorphic in chimpanzee individuals. Through computational analysis and manual inspection, we found that some of the chimpanzee-specific ERVs have propagated via non-classical PtERV insertion (NCPI), and at least one of the PtERVs may have played a role in creating an alternative transcript of a chimpanzee gene. Based on our findings in this study, we state that the chimpanzee-specific ERV element is one of the sources of chimpanzee genomic variations, some of which might be related to the alternative transcripts in the chimpanzee population.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    Economists believe that barter is the ultimate cause of social wealth-and even much of our human culture-yet little is known about the evolution and development of such behavior. It is useful to examine the circumstances under which other species will or will not barter to more fully understand the phenomenon. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are an interesting test case as they are an intelligent species, closely related to humans, and known to participate in reciprocal interactions and token economies with humans, yet they have not spontaneously developed costly barter. Methodology/Principle Findings. Although chimpanzees do engage in noncostly barter, in which otherwise value-less tokens are exchanged for food, this lack of risk is not typical of human barter. Thus, we systematically examined barter in chimpanzees to ascertain under what circumstances chimpanzees will engage in costly barter of commodities, that is, trading food items for other food items with a human experimenter. We found that chimpanzees do barter, relinquishing lower value items to obtain higher value items (and not the reverse). However, they do not trade in all beneficial situations, maintaining possession of less preferred items when the relative gains they stand to make are small. Conclusions/Significance. Two potential explanations for this puzzling behavior are that chimpanzees lack ownership norms, and thus have limited opportunity to benefit from the gains of trade, and that chimpanzees' risk of defection is sufficiently high that large gains must be imminent to justify the risk. Understanding the conditions that support barter in chimpanzees may increase understanding of situations in which humans, too, do not maximize their gains.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    The relationships between captive primates and their caregivers are critical ones and can affect animal welfare. Friendly relationships can improve quality of life; adversely, agonistic relationships can decrease quality of life. Caregivers in and of themselves should not be stressful to their charges, instead the caregivers' behaviour and the nature of their interactions with captive primates is likely the basis for the stress. One method to promote positive relationships in the captive environment is for caregivers to employ species-specific behaviours in their interactions with their charges. This study tested the effect of caregivers' use of these behaviors with chimpanzees at the Zoo Northwest Florida in Gulf Breeze. The Chimpanzee participants were three males. Data collection occurred during typical interactions between the human participants and the chimpanzees. Some days the caregiver presented chimpanzee behaviors and vocalizations (CB Chimpanzee Behavior Condition) in the data collection interactions with the chimpanzees. On the other days the caregiver presented human behaviors and used speech (HB-Human Behavior Condition) in the interactions with the chimpanzees. The interactions were videotaped. Data coders recorded the behavioral contexts for each chimpanzee as they occurred on the videotape and the time that each context began. Overall they engaged in significantly more friendly behaviors such as play in CB than in HB. They were significantly less interactive in HB than CB. Caregivers should understand and employ species-specific interactions with chimpanzees to promote friendly interactions and animal welfare. Zoo Biol 27:345-359. 2008. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</td>

    Six adult female chimpanzees were shown video scenes of chimpanzees repeatedly yawning or of chimpanzees showing open-mouth facial expressions that were not yawns. Two out of the six females showed significantly higher frequencies of yawning in response to yawn videos; no chimpanzees showed the inverse. Three infant chimpanzees that accompanied their mothers did not yawn at all. These data are highly reminiscent of the contagious yawning effects reported for humans. Contagious yawning is thought to be based on the capacity for empathy. Contagious yawning in chimpanzees provides further evidence that these apes may possess advanced self-awareness and empathic abilities.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    The unprecedented recent decision-making about chimpanzees supported for biomedical science by the US National Institutes of Health attracted international attention and significantly changed many dimensions of chimpanzee research. Many public and media portrayals incorrectly generalized the NIH findings to conclude that chimpanzee research itself was no longer necessary. In fact, the broader question of the necessity and value of the full range of chimpanzee research was never asked, evaluated, or within the NIH's primary charge. The Institute of Medicine evaluative panel found that research with chimpanzees was necessary for some, but not all, purposes. The panel's findings also led the NIH to introduce new standards for the care and management of NIH-supported chimpanzees and a new mechanism for ethical review of grant proposals involving chimpanzees. The NIH evaluation and decisions could not address all captive chimpanzees and all types of research. However, the process did underscore the need for a more expansive framework for continued ethical review and decision-making to responsibly address the future of captive chimpanzee management and research. Among the broader considerations are extension of evidence-informed standards to ensure equitable care and treatment of all chimpanzees; determining the global impact of limited captive populations; and balancing benefit and harm at individual, species, societal, and environmental levels. The breadth and longevity of impact from the current US decisions suggest the need for many voices, disciplines, and stakeholders to address the complex interplay between science, animal welfare, and global health.

    Does the chimpanzee attribute goals to others? Recent infant studies using the looking time measure have been interpreted as evidence that human infants attribute goals. An experiment modeled on these studies was can-led out on chimpanzees, and the chimpanzees responded the way infants do. This indicates that chimpanzees also attribute goals and hence that this capacity is not distinctively human. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    Thorpe et al. (Am J Phys Anthropol 110:179199, 1999) quantified chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) muscle architecture and joint moment arms to determine whether they functionally compensated for structural differences between chimpanzees and humans. They observed enough distinction to conclude that musculoskeletal properties were not compensatory and suggested that chimpanzees and humans do not exhibit dynamically similar movements. These investigators based their assessment on unilateral limb musculatures from three male chimpanzees, of which they called one non-adult representative. Factors such as age, sex, and behavioral lateralization may be responsible for variation in chimpanzee muscle architecture, but this is presently unknown. While the full extent of variation in chimpanzee muscle architecture due to such factors cannot be evaluated with data presently available, the present study expands the chimpanzee dataset and provides a preliminary glimpse of the potential relevance of these factors. Thirty-seven forelimb and 36 hind limb muscles were assessed in two chimpanzee cadavers: one unilaterally (right limbs), and one bilaterally. Mass, fiber length, and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) are reported for individual muscles and muscle groups. The musculature of an adult female is more similar in architectural patterns to a young male chimpanzee than to humans, particularly when comparing muscle groups. Age- and sex-related intraspecific differences do not obscure chimpanzee-human interspecific differences. Side asymmetry in one chimpanzee, despite consistent forelimb directional asymmetry, also does not exceed the magnitude of chimpanzee-human differences. Left forelimb muscles, on average, usually had higher masses and longer fiber lengths than right, while right forelimb muscles, on average, usually had greater PCSAs than left. Most muscle groups from the left forelimb exhibited greater masses than right groups, but group asymmetry was significant only for the manual digital muscles. The hind limb exhibited less asymmetry than the forelimb in most comparisons. Examination of additional chimpanzees would clarify the full range of inter- and intraindividual variation.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    Human empathy can extend to strangers and even other species, but it is unknown whether non-humans are similarly broad in their empathic responses. We explored the breadth and flexibility of empathy in chimpanzees, a close relative of humans. We used contagious yawning to measure involuntary empathy and showed chimpanzees videos of familiar humans, unfamiliar humans and gelada baboons (an unfamiliar species). We tested whether each class of stimuli elicited contagion by comparing the effect of yawn and control videos. After including previous data on the response to ingroup and outgroup chimpanzees, we found that familiar and unfamiliar humans elicited contagion equal to that of ingroup chimpanzees. Gelada baboons did not elicit contagion, and the response to them was equal to that of outgroup chimpanzees. However, the chimpanzees watched the outgroup chimpanzee videos more than any other. The combination of high interest and low contagion may stem from hostility towards unfamiliar chimpanzees, which may interfere with an empathic response. Overall, chimpanzees showed flexibility in that they formed an empathic connection with a different species, including unknown members of that species. These results imply that human empathic flexibility is shared with related species.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    In the late 1970s, Premack and Woodruff asked whether chimpanzees had a theory of mind. The answer to this question has remained elusive. Whereas some authors argue that chimpanzees are capable of mental state attribution, others maintain that they simply learn certain cues in ertain situations. Recent studies challenge both views. On the one hand, chimpanzees know much more about seeing than cue-based explanations suggest; on the other hand, this knowledge does not necessarily entail understanding of the mental states of others. The hypothesis I put forward here is that chimpanzees learn cues in social situations but that they are also capable of knowledge abstraction to solve novel problems.</td>

    This paper reports a study of fitness indicator theory in chimpanzees. First, it establishes a theoretical perspective for the study of fitness indicator theory and the relationships among indicators of fitness in humans and other animals. Second, it describes a methodology for assessing facial fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in a sample (N = 2 1) of zoo chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Third, associations among chimpanzee facial FA and health are described. FA was positively associated with negative health symptoms, and negatively associated with general health. Results are discussed under the framework of good genes theory.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    Infectious disease has only recently been recognized as a major threat to the survival of Endangered chimpanzees and Critically Endangered gorillas in the wild. One potentially powerful tool, vaccination, has not been deployed in fighting this disease threat, in good part because of fears about vaccine safety. Here we report on what is, to our knowledge, the first trial in which captive chimpanzees were used to test a vaccine intended for use on wild apes rather than humans. We tested a virus-like particle vaccine against Ebola virus, a leading source of death in wild gorillas and chimpanzees. The vaccine was safe and immunogenic. Captive trials of other vaccines and of methods for vaccine delivery hold great potential as weapons in the fight against wild ape extinction.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    After having followed the chimpanzees of Tai for two years, Jane Goodall generously invited me to visit the chimpanzees of Gombe. I was indeed very much in need of learning to estimate the age of young chimpanzees, something well-known in the Gombe community that had already been under study for 25 years. This visit became a real surprise for me as I very quickly noticed many differences between the Gombe and Tai chimpanzees.
    <br>To start with, it was, of course, a very different terrain with steep hills, much lower trees, and a high density of bush, compared to the homogeneous primary rainforest of Cote d'Ivoire. I vividly remember the first time I encountered the Gombe chimpanzees. I was high up in the hills following some individuals on a man-cut trail. They were calling loudly, and I noticed an adolescent male with a striking face, a long, dark back, and a thin rump moving with some others down the valley. I was somehow puzzled to see only young ones, no adult males. Moving through the valley, we were then joined by two mothers with babies on their backs. Altogether, it was a small party with about six individuals. Despite some calls, I heard no reply by any other chimpanzee. Throughout the whole day, I did not hear a single drumming and realized that buttressed trees, so frequent in the Tai forest, were absent in Gombe.
    <br>Once back in camp, I asked someone to translate the information I had been given by the field assistant, and I came to realize that the male I had considered an adolescent was actually Freud, the new beta male and one of the largest Gombe chimpanzee males! Thus, the size of the chimpanzees clearly differed. In addition, unlike at Tai, the Gombe males rarely drum because most of the bigger trees have very small and thick buttresses. It is not worth the effort to powerfully hit a buttress if the sound does not carry at least some distance. This may well be one of the reasons why group cohesion here initially seemed lower, i.e. different from Tai. Indeed, unlike at Tai, it was apparently common at Gombe to follow a party of chimpanzees while not hearing a sound from any other chimpanzees around.</td>

    Little is known about the history and population structure of our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees, in part because of an extremely poor fossil record. To address this, we report the largest genetic study of the chimpanzees to date, examining 310 microsatellites in 84 common chimpanzees and bonobos. We infer three common chimpanzee populations, which correspond to the previously defined labels of "western,'' "central,'' and "eastern," and find little evidence of gene flow between them. There is tentative evidence for structure within western chimpanzees, but we do not detect distinct additional populations. The data also provide historical insights, demonstrating that the western chimpanzee population diverged first, and that the eastern and central populations are more closely related in time.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    From 2006 to 2007, when I was still collecting data for my PhD under the Wild Chimpanzee Foundation, I initiated a dialogue with the logging companies. We discussed a sustainable logging plan to ensure the protection of priority areas which is vital for the survival of the wild chimpanzees in the surrounding forests of Tai National Park. Discussions were not easy and the Goin-Debe Classified Forest was already a poor secondary forest. Fortunately, the chimpanzees had survived the intense logging in the area. Surveys revealed that 250 chimpanzees still remained in this forest.
    <br>However, in 2010, the forest began to disappear piece by piece only to be replaced with illegal cocoa plantations and as the forest disappeared, so did the chimpanzee population. This devastation of an incredible species is what made me leave my research domain to support the Wild Chimpanzee Foundation and protect these marvellous creatures. Without our help, what is the likelihood of their survival if deforestation crosses West Africa like a bulldozer?
    <br>Giving up on my research was not easy, but what helped me during this transition was going back to the research area. All I would have to do is observe one of the habituated chimpanzee groups for a while. This short but crucial visit would clearly remind me of why I joined this fight.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    In this study we compared the nature of the joint attentional interactions that occurred as chimpanzees and human children engaged with a human experimenter (E). Subjects were three chimpanzees raised mostly with conspecifics (mother-reared), three chimpanzees raised in a human-like cultural environment (enculturated), and six 18-month-old human children. Of particular interest were possible differences between the two groups of chimpanzees that might have resulted from their differ ent ontogenetic histories. Observations were made as subjects participated in an imitative learning task involving a number of novel objects. Variables coded were such things as subjects' looks to the object, looks to E, the coordination of such looks in periods of joint engagement with E, and gestural attempts to direct E's attention or behavior (declaratives and imperatives). Results showed that enculturated chimpanzees were most similar to human children in social interactions involving objects, for example, in their attention to the object in compliance with E's request, their joint attentional interactions during less structured periods, and their use of declarative gestures to direct E's attention to objects. They were not similar to children, but rather resembled their mother-reared conspecifics, in the duration of their looks to E's face. A positive relation between subjects'joint attentional skills and their imitative learning skills was found for both chimpanzee and human subjects. It is concluded that a human-like sociocultural environment is an essential component in the development of human-like social-cognitive and joint attentional skills for chimpanzees, and perhaps for human beings as well.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    In order to compare evolved human and chimpanzees' life histories we present a synthetic life table for free-living chimpanzees, derived from data collected in five study populations (Gombe, Tai, Kibale, Mahale, Bossou). The combined data from all populations represent 3711 chimpanzee years at risk and 278 deaths. Males show higher mortality than females and data suggest some inter-site variation in mortality. Despite this variation, however, wild chimpanzees generally have a life expectancy at birth of less than 15 years and mean adult lifespan (after sexual maturity) is only about 15 years. This is considerably lower survival than that reported for chimpanzees in zoos Or captive breeding colonies, or that measured among modern human hunter-gatherers. The low mortality rate of human foragers relative to chimpanzees in the early adult years may partially explain why humans have evolved to senesce later than chimpanzees, and have a longer juvenile period.

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    In this study we compared the abilities of chimpanzees and human children to imitatively learn novel actions on objects. Of particular interest were possible differences between chimpanzees raised mostly with conspecifics (mother-reared) and chimpanzees raised in a human-like cultural environment (enculturated). Subjects were thus 3 enculturated and 3 mother-reared chimpanzees, along with 8 18-month-old and 8 30-month-old human children. Each subject was tested over a 2-day period with 16 novel objects. The introduction of each object was preceded by a baseline period in which the subject's natural proclivities toward the object were determined. For 12 objects, a human experimenter demonstrated first a simple and then a complex novel action, instructing the subject in each case to ''Do what I do'' (chimpanzees were prepared for the task behaviorally as well). For the other 4 objects, demonstration of a single action took place on the first clay and the subject's opportunity to imitate was delayed until the second clay, 48 hours later. Actions that a subject produced in baseline were excluded from further analysis. For each analyzed action, the subject's behavior was scored as to whether it successfully reproduced (1) the end result of the demonstrated action, and (2) the behavioral means used by the demonstrator. Results showed that in immediate imitation the mother-reared chimpanzees were much poorer imitators than the enculturated chimpanzees and the human children, who did not differ from one another. Surprisingly, on the delay trials, the enculturated chimpanzees significantly outperformed the other 3 groups. We conclude from these results that a human-like sociocultural environment is an essential component in the development of human-like social-cognitive and imitative learning skills for chimpanzees, and perhaps for human beings as well.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    The sharing of wild plant foods is infrequent in chimpanzees, but in chimpanzee communities that engage in hunting, meat is frequently used as a 'social tool' for nurturing alliances and social bonds. Here we report the only recorded example of regular sharing of plant foods by unrelated, non-provisioned wild chimpanzees, and the contexts in which these sharing behaviours occur. From direct observations, adult chimpanzees at Bossou (Republic of Guinea, West Africa) very rarely transferred wild plant foods. In contrast, they shared cultivated plant foods much more frequently (58 out of 59 food sharing events). Sharing primarily consists of adult males allowing reproductively cycling females to take food that they possess. We propose that hypotheses focussing on 'food-for-sex and -grooming' and 'showing-off' strategies plausibly account for observed sharing behaviours. A changing human-dominated landscape presents chimpanzees with fresh challenges, and our observations suggest that crop-raiding provides adult male chimpanzees at Bossou with highly desirable food commodities that may be traded for other currencies.</td>

    The literature pertaining to chimpanzee social structure, mating strategies, and dispersal is extensive, and attests to the complexity of chimpanzee behavior and population dynamics. Authors report data from several long-term studies and many shorter studies of wild and captive chimpanzees that pertain to reproductive strategies and associated behavior, but no previous attempt has been made to bring together these data into one document. This review summarizes the data and conclusions from behavioral studies of chimpanzees, and puts them into the context of reproductive strategies. (C) 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</td>

    Chimpanzees with the help of reconstruction and the "step-by-step" analysis of a figure - sample can plan a circuit of actions, forming an image of an end result. Ability to such actions proves at them an opportunity of cogitative operations, allowing to collect multielement figures on a sample. Generalization of concrete operations with concrete elements creates the precondition for the generalized understanding of a principle of actions knowledge - in general to collect separate elements in complex designs. In it the powerful conceptual potential chimpanzees is covered. It allows to use chimpanzees as model preverbal a level of thinking.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    The chimpanzee is the only representative of the Great Apes that is extensively involved in biomedical research in primate laboratories. These apes are used as animal models in a variety of studies, including research on infectious disease, parasitic disease, pharmacokinetic studies, neuroscience, cognition, and behavior. Chimpanzees used in biomedical research in the United States reside largely in six specialized research and holding facilities, and most of the research with them is conducted at these sites. Given the relatively small population of chimpanzees and its importance to biomedical research, it is imperative that we carefully manage the care, production, and use of these animals in biomedical research studies. Selection criteria and preparation techniques are reviewed in this article in an effort to begin a discussion on best practices for choosing and handling chimpanzees participating in biomedical research. The use of routine health assessment information is described for subject selection, as are behavioral issues to be considered. Due to the relatively small number of chimpanzees available, issues related to experimental design and multiple uses of chimpanzees are discussed. Practices related to the transportation and acclimation of chimpanzees are described. Finally, behavioral conditioning procedures are discussed, including habituation, desensitization, and positive reinforcement training that have been applied to reduce animal distress and improve the quality of the science being conducted with chimpanzee subjects.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    There is a growing interest in the study of personality in chimpanzees with repeated findings of a similar structure of personality in apes to that found in humans. To date, however, the direct translational value of instruments used to assess chimpanzee personality to humans has yet to be explicitly tested. As such, in the current study we sought to determine the transportability of factor analytically-derived chimpanzee personality scales to humans in a large human sample (N = 301). Human informants reporting on target individuals they knew well completed chimpanzee-derived and human-derived measures of personality from the two most widely studied models of human personality: Big Five and Big Three. The correspondence between informant-reported chimpanzee-and human-derived personality scales was then investigated. Results indicated high convergence for corresponding scales across most chimpanzee-and human-derived personality scales. Findings from the current study provide evidence that chimpanzee-derived scales translate well to humans and operate quite similarly to the established human-derived personality scales in a human sample. This evidence of transportability lends support to the translational nature of chimpanzee personality research suggesting clear relevance of this growing literature to humans. Am. J.

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    While field studies of wild chimpanzees have investigated the proximate determinants of hunting success, little attention has been paid to the decision to hunt. We present evidence from Gombe National Park, Tanzania, showing that the social factors that most strongly influence the decision to hunt red colobus monkeys are the presence of female chimpanzees with anogenital sexual swellings in the foraging party, the number of adult and adolescent males in the party, and the total size of the foraging party. Of these, the presence of one or more swollen females was the best predictor of a decision to undertake hunts of red colobus groups at all but the smalles chimpanzee foraging party size. Two likely explanations for this pattern are discussed. First, swollen females may be a primary influence on male grouping patterns, which in turn promotes hunting. Second, this finding, together with previous research showing that male chimpanzees preferentially give meat to estrous females, suggests that male chimpanzee hunting performance may be under sexual selection. While nutritional and ecological factors may influence chimpanzee hunting patterns at times, chimpanzees appear to hunt red colobus at least partially to obtain meat for use as a social and reproductive tool.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    In the 1970s, researchers provided the first detailed descriptions of intergroup conflict in chimpanzees. These observations stimulated numerous comparisons between chimpanzee violence and human warfare. Such comparisons have attracted three main objections: (a) The data supporting such comparisons are too few, (b) intergroup aggression is the result of artificial feeding by observers, and (c) chimpanzee data are irrelevant to understanding human warfare. Recent studies provide strong evidence against these criticisms. Data from the five long-term sites with neighboring groups show that intergroup aggression is a pervasive feature of chimpanzee societies, including sites where artificial feeding never took place. Recent studies have clarified questions about the functional goals and proximate mechanisms underlying intergroup aggression. Male chimpanzees compete with males in other groups over territory, food, and females, base their decisions to attack strangers on assessments of numerical strength, and strive for dominance over neighboring groups. Human males likewise compete over territory, food, and females and show a preference for low-risk attacks and intergroup dominance. Chimpanzee studies illustrate the promise of the behavioral biology approach for understanding and addressing the roots of violence in our own species.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    Background: The evolution of altruism has been explained mainly from ultimate perspectives. However, it remains to be investigated from a proximate point of view how and in which situations such social propensity is achieved. We investigated chimpanzees' targeted helping in a tool transfer paradigm, and discuss the similarities and differences in altruism between humans and chimpanzees. Previously it has been suggested that chimpanzees help human experimenters by retrieving an object which the experimenter is trying to reach. In the present study, we investigated the importance of communicative interactions between chimpanzees themselves and the influence of conspecific partner's request on chimpanzees' targeted helping.
    <br>Methodology/Principal Findings: We presented two tool-use situations ( a stick-use situation and a straw-use situation) in two adjacent booths, and supplied non-corresponding tools to paired chimpanzees in the two booths. For example, a chimpanzee in the stick-use situation was supplied with a straw, and the partner in the straw-use situation possessed a stick. Spontaneous tool transfer was observed between paired chimpanzees. The tool transfer events occurred predominantly following recipients' request. Even without any hope of reciprocation from the partner, the chimpanzees continued to help the partner as long as the partner required help.
    <br>Conclusions/Significance: These results provide further evidence for altruistic helping in chimpanzees in the absence of direct personal gain or even immediate reciprocation. Our findings additionally highlight the importance of request as a proximate mechanism motivating prosocial behavior in chimpanzees whether between kin or non-kin individuals and the possible confounding effect of dominance on the symmetry of such interactions. Finally, in contrast to humans, our study suggests that chimpanzees rarely perform acts of voluntary altruism. Voluntary altruism in chimpanzees is not necessarily prompted by simple observation of another's struggle to attain a goal and therefore an accurate understanding of others' desires in the absence of communicative signals.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    No report has confirmed predation on wild chimpanzees by lions. Recently, at least two lions visited the Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania. Chimpanzee remains, including hairs, bones, and a tooth, were found in four samples of lion feces between June and September 1989. The discovery of each fecal sample, widely separated in time, combined with analyses of daily attendance records and fecal contents, suggests that at least four chimpanzees, including two adult females, an old adolescent male, and an early adolescent male, were eaten. Observed responses of chimpanzees to lions included alarm calls, whimpers, climbing into trees, and silence. Predation by lions has been neglected as a factor shaping the social structure of chimpanzees. Nevertheless, the large party size that has often been observed in savanna-living chimpanzees, which are sympatric with lions, might be an anti-predator response of this species.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) use tools to probe for out-of-reach food, both in the wild and in captivity. Beyond gathering appropriately-sized materials to create tools, chimpanzees also perform secondary modifications in order to create an optimized tool. In this study, we recorded the behavior of a group of zoo-housed chimpanzees when presented with opportunities to use tools to probe for liquid foods in an artificial termite mound within their enclosure. Previous research with this group of chimpanzees has shown that they are proficient at gathering materials from within their environment in order to create tools to probe for the liquid food within the artificial mound. Extending beyond this basic question, we first asked whether they only made and modified probe tools when it was appropriate to do so (i.e. when the mound was baited with food). Second, by collecting continuous data on their behavior, we also asked whether the chimpanzees first (intentionally) modified their tools prior to probing for food or whether such modifications occurred after tool use, possibly as a by-product of chewing and eating the food from the tools. Following our predictions, we found that tool modification predicted tool use; the chimpanzees began using their tools within a short delay of creating and modifying them, and the chimpanzees performed more tool modifying behaviors when food was available than when they could not gain food through the use of probe tools. We also discuss our results in terms of the chimpanzees' acquisition of the skills, and their flexibility of tool use and learning. Am. J. Primatol. 77:162-170, 2015.

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    We report a case of chimpanzee trisomy 22 in a captive-born female. Because chromosome 22 in great apes is homologous to human chromosome 21, the present case is analogous to human trisomy 21, also called Down syndrome. The chimpanzee in the present case experienced retarded growth; infantile cataract and vision problems, including nystagmus, strabismus, and keratoconus; congenital atrial septal defect; and hypodontia. All of these symptoms are common in human Down syndrome. This case was the second reported case of trisomy 22 in the chimpanzee. The chimpanzee in our case became blind by 7 years old, making social life with other chimpanzees difficult, but opportunities to interact with other conspecific individuals have been offered routinely. We believe that providing her with the best care over the course of her life will be essential.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    This paper aims to summarize the existing evidence for the symbolic representation of number in chimpanzees. Chimpanzees can represent, to some extent, both the cardinal and the ordinal aspect of number. Through the medium of Arabic numerals we compared working memory in humans and chimpanzees using the same apparatus and following the same procedure. Three young chimpanzees outperformed human adults in memorizing briefly presented numerals. However, we found that chimpanzees were less proficient at a variety of other cognitive tasks including imitation, cross-modal matching, symmetry of symbols and referents, and one-to-one correspondence. In sum, chimpanzees do not possess human-like capabilities for representation at an abstract level. The present paper will discuss the constraints of the number concept in chimpanzees, and illuminate some unique features of human cognition.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    The study of the archaeological remains of fossil hominins must rely on reconstructions to elucidate the behaviour that may have resulted in particular stone tools and their accumulation. Comparatively, stone tool use among living primates has illuminated behaviours that are also amenable to archaeological examination, permitting direct observations of the behaviour leading to artefacts and their assemblages to be incorporated. Here, we describe newly discovered stone tool-use behaviour and stone accumulation sites in wild chimpanzees reminiscent of human cairns. In addition to data from 17 mid- to long-term chimpanzee research sites, we sampled a further 34 Pan troglodytes communities. We found four populations in West Africa where chimpanzees habitually bang and throw rocks against trees, or toss them into tree cavities, resulting in conspicuous stone accumulations at these sites. This represents the first record of repeated observations of individual chimpanzees exhibiting stone tool use for a purpose other than extractive foraging at what appear to be targeted trees. The ritualized behavioural display and collection of artefacts at particular locations observed in chimpanzee accumulative stone throwing may have implications for the inferences that can be drawn from archaeological stone assemblages and the origins of ritual sites.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    In this study, facial asymmetry in chimpanzees was assessed using a technique that has traditionally been implemented in human studies. Image composites made of each half of chimpanzees' facial expressions were presented to humans with and without chimpanzee experience. The group of subjects with chimpanzee experience considered composites made of the left side of the chimpanzee faces as the most emotionally intense for the emotional categories of play, silent bared-teeth, scream face, and a neutral category. On the other hand, left-left composites were not consistently judged by subjects with and without chimpanzee experience as the most similar to the whole original face, which might be explained as the result of an attentional bias in the human observers towards the right side of the chimpanzee expressions. Furthermore, responses given by subjects with and without chimpanzee experience were highly correlated, which indicates that the two groups of humans perceived the chimpanzee facial expressions in a similar fashion. The finding of left-sided asymmetries in these chimpanzees' facial expressions suggests a right hemisphere asymmetry in the production of emotions in this species and it is consistent with results reported in human and other nonhuman primates.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    Literature on the mental capacities and cognitive mechanisms of the great apes has been silent about whether they can act autonomously. This paper provides a philosophical theory of autonomy supported by psychological studies of the cognitive mechanisms that underlie chimpanzee behavior to argue that chimpanzees can act autonomously even though their psychological mechanisms differ from those of humans. Chimpanzees satisfy the two basic conditions of autonomy: (1) liberty (the absence of controlling influences) and (2) agency (self-initiated intentional action), each of which is specified here in terms of conditions of understanding, intention, and self-control. In this account, chimpanzees make knowledge-based choices reflecting a richly information-based and socially sophisticated understanding of the world. Finally, two major theories of autonomy (Kantian theory and two-level theory) are rejected as too narrow to adequately address these issues, necessitating the modifications made in the present approach.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    To analyze how the chimpanzees in the Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania, change their grouping pattern, activity budget, travel speed, and travel distance within an annual cycle, I divided 1-year data into four periods. The Mahale chimpanzees have the behavioral flexibility to adapt to various climates and exhibited at least three behavioral seasons. In the early wet season, chimpanzees formed a few, large parties, and spent much time feeding on insects and animal meat. In the early and late dry seasons, chimpanzees maintained party sizes as large as in the early wet season, and traveled distances similar to the early wet season, but spent the most time feeding and traveling within the year. By contrast, in the late wet season chimpanzee parties broke up into more numerous, small groups, and traveled slowly over shorter distances. Although time spent feeding and traveling were the same as that in the early wet season, time spent feeding on terrestrial herbaceous vegetation (THV) was the highest in the year. The results suggest that chimpanzees travel longer, faster, and farther in seasons when they form large parties.</td>

    Do chimpanzees have better spatial working memory than humans? In a previous report, a juvenile chimpanzee outperformed 3 university students on memory for briefly displayed digits in a spatial array (Inoue &amp; Matsuzawa, 2007). The authors described these abilities as extraordinary and likened the chimpanzee's performance to eidetic memory. However, the chimpanzee received extensive practice on a non-time-pressured version of the task; the human subjects received none. Here we report that, after adequate practice, 2 university students substantially outperformed the chimpanzee. There is no evidence for a superior or qualitatively different spatial memory system in chimpanzees.</td>

    Although the chimpanzee displays an immunological response to an HIV-1 challenge, it is a deficient animal model in aids research since it never develops the progressive symptoms of the disease. The continued use of the chimpanzee is also precluded because of its endangered status in the wild, the high cost per animal, and its failure to exhibit a CD4 decline (apoptosis) while infected. However, it is likely that the chimpanzee model will continue to be used in investigations relating to the epidemiology and mucosal transmission of the human AIDS virus.</td>

    Nine male chimpanzees originally reared in solitary cages were set up to form a group. Plasma viral load of the lymphocryptovirus (LCV) of chimpanzee [Epstein Barr virus chimpanzee (EBVcmp)] was measured by real-time PCR. In the group formation (Form) period, the first-ranking male showed an imminent increase in plasma EBVcmp load compared with 1 week before (pre-Form) and 3 months after (post-Form) group formation. Other upper-ranking males such as the second-, third- and fourth-male also showed the highest level of viral load in the Form period. The kinetics of EBVcmp load in the Form period were statistically different from other periods (against pre-Form, t=-4.878, P&lt;0.001; against post-Form, t=6.434, P&lt;0.001). The effect of the male dominance rank did not differ between the pre-Form and post-Form periods (t=-1.557, P=0.12). Reactivation of LCV (EBV) as an immunological stress marker for humans might also be applied to chimpanzees.</td>

    The relationships between captive primates and their caregivers are critical ones and can affect animal welfare. This study tested the effect of caregivers using chimpanzee behaviors or not, in daily interactions with captive chimpanzees. In the Chimpanzee Behavior (CB) condition the caregiver presented chimpanzee behaviors. In the Human Behavior (HB) condition the caregiver avoided using chimpanzee behaviors. The chimpanzees had individual patterns of response and had significant differences in their responses to each condition. These data are compared to a similar study conducted at The Zoo Northwest Florida (ZNWF). Both groups of chimpanzees were sensitive and responsive to the differences in conditions. These data suggest ways to improve animal welfare.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    Comparative studies of social responsiveness, a core impairment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), will enhance our understanding of typical and atypical social behavior. We previously reported a quantitative, cross-species (human-chimpanzee) social responsiveness measure, which included the development of the Chimpanzee Social Responsiveness Scale (CSRS). Here, we augment our prior CSRS sample with 25 zoo chimpanzees at three sites: combined N = 54. The CSRS demonstrated strong interrater reliability, and low-ranked chimpanzees, on average, displayed higher CSRS scores. The CSRS continues to discriminate variation in chimpanzee social responsiveness, and the association of higher scores with lower chimpanzee social standing has implications for the relationship between autistic traits and human social status. Continued comparative investigations of social responsiveness will enhance our understanding of underlying impairments in ASD, improve early diagnosis, and inform future therapies.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    The identification and recruitment of trustworthy partners represents an important adaptive challenge for any species that relies heavily on cooperation [1, 2]. From an evolutionary perspective, trust is difficult to account for as it involves, by definition, a risk of non-reciprocation and defection by cheaters [3, 4]. One solution for this problem is to form close emotional bonds, i.e., friendships, which enable trust even in contexts where cheating would be profitable [5]. Little is known about the evolutionary origins of the human tendency to form close social bonds to overcome the trust problem. Studying chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), one of our closest living relatives, is one way of identifying these origins. While a growing body of research indicates that at least some of the properties of close human relationships find parallels in the social bonds of chimpanzees [6-10] and that chimpanzees extend favors preferentially toward selected individuals [11-14], it is unclear whether such interactions are based on trust. To fill this gap in knowledge, we observed the social interactions of a group of chimpanzees and established dyadic friendship relations. We then presented chimpanzees with a modified, non-verbal version of the human trust game and found that chimpanzees trust their friends significantly more frequently than their non-friends. These results suggest that trust within closely bonded dyads is not unique to humans but rather has its evolutionary roots in the social relationships of our closest primate relatives.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    The isolation of phylogenetically distinct primate immunodeficiency viruses from at least seven wild-born, captive chimpanzees indicates that viruses closely related to HIV-1 may be endemic in some wild chimpanzee populations. The search for the chimpanzee population or populations harbouring these viruses is therefore on. This paper attempts to answer the question of whether or not such populations of chimpanzees are likely to exist at all, and, if so, where they are likely to be found. We summarize what is known about gene flow in wild populations of chimpanzees, both between major phylogeographical subdivisions of the species, and within these subdivisions. Our analysis indicates that hitherto undocumented reproductively isolated chimpanzee populations may in fact exist. This conclusion is based on the observation that, despite limited geographical sampling and limited numbers of genetic loci, conventional notions of the nature and extent of chimpanzee gene flow have recently been substantially revised. Molecular genetic studies using mitochondrial DNA sequences and hypervariable nuclear microsatellite markers have indicated the existence of heretofore undocumented barriers to chimpanzee gene flow. These studies have identified at least one population of chimpanzees genetically distinct enough to be classified into a new subspecies (Pan troglodytes vellerosus). At the same time, they have called into question the long-accepted genetic distinction between eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) and western equatorial chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes). The same studies have further indicated that gene flow between local populations is more extensive than was previously thought, and follows patterns sometimes inconsistent with those documented through direct behavioural observation. Given the apparently incomplete nature of the current understanding of chimpanzee gene flow in equatorial Africa, it seems reasonable to speculate that a chimpanzee population or populations may exist which both harbour the putative HIV-1 ancestor, and which have remained reproductively isolated from other chimpanzee populations over the time-scale relevant to the evolution of the SIVcpz-HIV-1 complex of viruses. Continued extensive sampling of wild chimpanzee populations, both for their genes and their viruses, should be performed quickly considering the high probability of extinction that many wild chimpanzee populations face today. The history of human-chimpanzee contacts is discussed.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are the only great apes that inhabit hot, dry, and open savannas. We review the environmental pressures of savannas on chimpanzees, such as food and water scarcity, and the evidence for chimpanzees' behavioral responses to these landscapes. In our analysis, savannas were generally associated with low chimpanzee population densities and large home ranges. In addition, thermoregulatory behaviors that likely reduce hyperthermia risk, such as cave use, were frequently observed in the hottest and driest savanna landscapes. We hypothesize that such responses are evidence of a "savanna landscape effect" in chimpanzees and offer pathways for future research to understand its evolutionary processes and mechanisms. We conclude by discussing the significance of research on savanna chimpanzees to modeling the evolution of early hominin traits and informing conservation programs for these endangered apes.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) readily infects both humans and chimpanzees, but the pathologic outcomes of infection in these two species differ greatly.  In attempts to identify virus-cell interactions that might account for this differential pathogenicity, chimpanzee peripheral blood lymphocytes and bone marrow macrophages were assessed in vitro for their ability to support the replication of several HIV-1 isolates.  Although the IIIb, RF, and MN isolates did not readily infect chimpanzee peripheral blood lymphocytes, an isolate of HIV-1 passaged in vivo in chimpanzees not only replicated well in both chimpanzee peripheral blood lymphocytes and bone marrow macrophages but also was cytopathic for chimpanzee CD4+ lymphocytes.  Because no evidence of HIV-induced disease has been observed in chimpanzees infected with this isolate, in vitro replication to high titers with concomitant loss of CD4+ cells is not, in this instance, a correlate of pathogenicity.  These observations, therefore, indicate that caution must be used when making extrapolations from in vitro data to in vivo pathogenesis.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    Do chimpanzees engage in religious behaviors? To date this question remains unanswered. I use methods from religious studies and anthropology of religion that demonstrate an answer in the affirmative. A comprehensive review of primatology reports reveals that chimpanzees do perform ritualized patterns of behavior in response to birth, death, consortship, and elemental natural phenomena. A structuralist analysis of these patterns shows that chimpanzees deploy similar formulaic action schemas involving recombination of syntagmatic and paradigmatic behaviors across all four of these life-situations. In the course of these performances, chimpanzees decontextualize and convert everyday communicative signals to express non-ordinary emotions of wonder and awe. The patterning of chimpanzee ritual behaviors evidences all the components of a prototypical trans-species definition of religion. These findings support hypotheses that propose religious behaviors for other species, including hominins prior to Homo sapiens sapiens.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    Sign language studies of chimpanzees are a tool for studying the continuity between human behavior and behavior of other animals and between verbal behavior and other intelligent behavior. Cross-fostered chimpanzees paralleled children in their acquisition and use of signs and phrases. These procedures occurred under rigorous and systematic record keeping and experimental paradigms. The study of Wh-questions and the use of remote videotaping (RVT) are examples of experimental procedures. These revealed chimpanzee-to-chimpanzee signing and private signing. Face-to-face interactions between the chimpanzees and an interlocutor who presented various systematic probes is another experimental procedure. The chimpanzees adjusted to the interlocutor with revisions, new signs, or no response when appropriate. The hallmark of the sign language studies is that caregivers treated the chimpanzees as conversational partners socially motivated rather than experimental subjects bribed or forced into participation. These findings confirm continuity with differences of degree among species.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    To gain insight into the patterns of genetic variation and evolutionary relationships within and between bonobos and chimpanzees, we sequenced 150,000 base pairs of nuclear DNA divided among 15 autosomal regions as well as the complete mitochondrial genomes from 20 bonobos and 58 chimpanzees. Except for western chimpanzees, we found poor genetic separation of chimpanzees based on sample locality. In contrast, bonobos consistently cluster together but fall as a group within the variation of chimpanzees for many of the regions. Thus, while chimpanzees retain genomic variation that predates bonobo-chimpanzee speciation, extensive lineage sorting has occurred within bonobos such that much of their genome traces its ancestry back to a single common ancestor that postdates their origin as a group separate from chimpanzees.</td>

For example, people frequently produce manual gestures while speaking, and the words a person perceives are impacted by visual information. For this study, we hypothesized that similar to the way that humans regularly couple their spoken utterances with gestures and facial expressions, chimpanzees regularly produce vocalizations in conjunction with other communicative signals. To test this hypothesis, data were collected from 101 captive chimpanzees living in mixed-sex social groupings of seven to twelve individuals. A total of 2,869 vocal events were collected. The data indicate that approximately 50% of the vocal events were produced in conjunction with another communicative modality. In addition, approximately 68% were directed to a specific individual, and these directed vocalizations were more likely to include a signal from another communicative modality than were vocalizations that were not directed to a specific individual. These results suggest that, like humans, chimpanzees often pair their vocalizations with signals from other communicative modalities. In addition, chimpanzees appear to use their communicative signals strategically to meet specific socio-communicative ends, providing support for the growing literature that indicates that at least some chimpanzee vocal signaling is intentional.

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    The respective influences of exposure and inborn neural networks on conspecific and nonconspecific face processing remain unclear. Although the importance of exposure in the development of object and face recognition in general is well documented, studies explicitly comparing face recognition across species showed a species-specific effect. For instance, laboratory monkeys exposed daily to human faces were better at discriminating monkeys than humans, suggesting that the role of exposure may not be the only factor affecting cross-species recognition. In the present study, the authors investigated conspecific and nonconspecific face recognition in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) from 2 primate centers that provided different exposure to chimpanzee and human faces. The authors showed that the chimpanzees from the center providing more exposure to human faces than to chimpanzee faces were better at discriminating human faces than they were at discriminating chimpanzee faces. The chimpanzees from the other center did not show the same effect. A computational simulation was developed to evaluate the average similarities among human pictures and among chimpanzee pictures. Both categories were comparable. Chimpanzees' scores were significantly correlated with the similarity coefficients. Overall, the results show that exposure is a critical determinant in conspecific and nonconspecific face recognition.</td>

    <b>Abstract:</b>
    This paper provides evidence for imitative abilities in neonatal chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), our closest relatives. Two chimpanzees were reared from birth by their biological mothers. At less than 7 days of age the chimpanzees could discriminate between, and imitate, human facial gestures (tongue protrusion and mouth opening). By the tune they were 2 months old, however; the chimpanzees no longer imitated the gestures. They began to perform mouth opening frequently in response to any of the three facial gestures presented to them. These findings suggest that neonatal facial imitation is most likely an innate ability, developed through natural selection in humans and in chimpanzees. The relationship between the disappearance of neonatal imitation and the development of social communicative behavior is discussed from an evolutionary perspective.</td>
